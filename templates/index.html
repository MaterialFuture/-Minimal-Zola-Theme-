I create software that helps people's lives easier without comprimizing on their <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/linux-gnu-freedom.en.html" title="Linux, GNU, and Freedom - Richard Stallman" rel="external opener nofollow" target="_blank">freedoms</a>. I also write articles regarding my life as well as what I've learned in my professional life.</p>
                    <h2 id="my-work">My Work</h2>
                    <p>I mainly work on offline-compatible application that require's very little from the user to get working. Examples of software projects I'm working on are listed <a href="/projects">on the projects page</a>.</p>
                    <p>For non-software related work, I research User Experience and write papers in regards to that. You can read my <a href="/papers">papers here</a> or you can search the tags of my posts and find any <a href="/tags">relevant tags</a> regarding my writings.</p>
                    <h2 id="my-goals">My Goals</h2>
                    <p>My goals are constantly changing as I want to constantly improve so there's no end-goal just a constantly and consistant pursuit towards bettering myself and others. I focus primarily on offline application and technologies and hope by end of 2020 to have the services that I use to be either decentralized and in my control or be offline only. The reason for this is too long to write here, so I'll link to a blog post when the time comes.</p>
                    <h2 id="this-site">This Site</h2>
                    <p>This site was initially a place for me to put my blog posts and links to things, but that has since changed. This site is also a personal wiki for personal and public use that defines different aspects of what I do.
                        You can consider this part Blog/Wiki/Resource for all of what I do.</p>
                    <p>I also try and provide links to software alternative as well as useful links for people to link to and share. </p>
                    <p>This site is offline capable, running nicely on Lynx, and contains an RSS feed for posts.</p>
